# competitive-league-analysis
Analysing League of Legends' competitive scenario. Using data from Oracle's Elixir, I check if my assumption that "Winning game 4 makes you more likely to win the series" is true.

### Research questions
1. In a 5-games series, does winning game 4 makes a team more likely to also win game 5?
2. Does the answer to RQ1 holds true to all regions?
3. Has it changed throughout the years?
